//  Rust functions start with fn, have the parameters defined inside () and the return type after ->
//  Variables are constant by default and adding mut before their definition changes this.
//  The type can be explicity passed by using <variable_name>: <type>
//
//  Constants can only be set to expressions that evaluate in compile-time
//
//  Tuples are arrays-objects that can hold multiple elements of different types
//  Arrays are like arrays... they have fixed size
//  Vectors are like in C++, they have mutable size
//  Rust will not automatically try to convert non-Boolean types to a Boolean

// To get the functions from another file:
mod funcs;
mod hang;

fn main() {
    todo!();
}
