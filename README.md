## Programming Languages Practice

This is my practical learning repo, where i store initial learning code for the languages i want to learn.

My language roadmap:

- Functions, classes/structures, array/string manipulation, etc.
- Error handling, testing, documentation, concurrency.
- Understand/learn most common used frameworks/libraries.
- Try to understand how the language evolved so i can stick to the best practices.
- Understand why the language is used more on some areas, like JavaScript for web development and C for operating systems.
