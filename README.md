## Programming Languages Practice

This serves as my practical learning repo, where i store about data structures, algorithms, syntax, etc.
Those things are related to a particular language, common on them, but work differently, so i think they should be practiced.

My language roadmap:
(For every language that i would like to learn, based on an OOP approach)

- Creation of functions, classes/structures, array manipulation, etc.
  * Create a separated folder for every different language code, with algorithms and data structures on them.
- Error handling, testing, documentation, concurrency.
- Try to understand how the language evolved so i can use nowadays best practices. (AKA: avoid writing old-style code)
- Understand/learn most common used frameworks/libraries
